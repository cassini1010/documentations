# Jira Testing Cycle

## Planning and creating test cases.

- requirement gathering: gather based on user stories. 

- test case design: Each test case should have clear steps, expected results, and any prerequisites. 

## Organize the test cases.

- Test Plan: outlines the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for the testing activities. 

- Test Suites: Group related test cases into test suites for better organization and management. 

## Execution

Test Execution: execute manually or automatically. Note the results in each test step or test case. Attache required evidence. 

## Report bug

Issues found during testing? Create a bug ticket to dev team. Link the relevant test case/user story/requirement to the bug ticket. 

## Retest

After the bug is fixed, the test is redone to ensure its fixed. 

## Test summary

At the end of the testing cycle, compile a test summary report that highlights the overall test execution status, key findings, and any remaining risks.
